      <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The Eiffel Tower</li>
        <p> The Eiffel Tower is an iconic iron structure located in Paris, France. Built by engineer Gustave
          Eiffel for the 1889 World's Fair, it stands 330 meters tall and was initially criticized by some
          for
          its design. However, it quickly became a global symbol of French engineering and architectural
          innovation. The tower has three observation levels, offering panoramic views of Paris, and is
          one of
          the most visited monuments in the world. Originally meant to be dismantled after 20 years, it
          was
          preserved due to its value for communications technology and has since become a beloved
          landmark.
        </p>

          century, showcasing art, sculptures, and artifacts from various cultures. The museum is renowned
