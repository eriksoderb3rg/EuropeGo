            <h2>Top Attractions</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>The Eiffel Tower</h3>
                    <p>The Eiffel Tower is an iconic iron structure located in Paris, France. Built by engineer Gustave
                        Eiffel
                        for the 1889 World's Fair, it stands 330 meters tall and was initially criticized by some for
                        its
                        design. However, it quickly became a global symbol of French engineering and architectural
                        innovation.
                        The tower has three observation levels, offering panoramic views of Paris, and is one of the
                        most
                        visited monuments in the world. Originally meant to be dismantled after 20 years, it was
                        preserved due
                        to its value for communications technology and has since become a beloved landmark.</p>

                    <h3>The Louvre Museum</h3>
                    <p>The Louvre Museum, located in Paris, France, is the world's largest art museum and a historic
                        monument.
                        Originally a royal palace, it became a public museum in 1793 after the French Revolution. The
                        Louvre
                        houses over 35,000 works of art, including famous pieces like Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa and
                        the
                        ancient Greek statue Venus de Milo. Its collections span from antiquity to the 19th century,
                        showcasing
                        art, sculptures, and artifacts from various cultures. The museum is renowned for its vast and
                        diverse
                        collection, attracting millions of visitors each year.</p>

            <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
            <p><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> Spring (April-June) and Fall (September-October) for mild weather
                and fewer crowds.</p>

            <p><strong>Local Customs:</strong> Greet with "Bonjour" (hello) and "Merci" (thank you). Dress smartly,
                especially in restaurants and churches. Tipping is included, but rounding up is appreciated.</p>

            <p><strong>Transportation:</strong> Metro: Fast and affordable; multi-day passes available. Walking: Ideal
                for exploring central areas. Bikes: Use the “Vélib” bike-share for short trips. Uber and taxis are
                available, but taxis cost more at night. Paris is best enjoyed at a relaxed pace, embracing its cultural
                charm.</p>
