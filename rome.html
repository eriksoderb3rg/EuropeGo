      <h2>Travel Tips</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Best Time to Visit:</strong> Spring (April-June) and Fall (September-October) for pleasant weather
          and fewer tourists.</li>
        <li><strong>Local Customs:</strong> Greet with "Buongiorno" (good morning) and "Grazie" (thank you). Dress
          modestly when visiting churches, including the Vatican.</li>
        <li><strong>Transportation:</strong> Metro and buses are the best options for public transport. Walking is ideal
          for the city center. Taxis and ridesharing services are also available. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded
          areas.</li>
