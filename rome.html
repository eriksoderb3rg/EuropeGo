      <ul>
        <li>The Colosseum</li>
        <p>
          The Colosseum is an ancient Roman amphitheater located in Rome, Italy. Built between 70-80 AD, it
          could hold up to 50,000 spectators and was used for gladiatorial contests, public spectacles, and
          dramas. It remains a symbol of Roman engineering and is one of the most visited landmarks in the
          world. Today, it stands partially ruined due to earthquakes and stone theft but is a significant
          historical site, offering tours that delve into its rich past.

          Best Time to Visit:
          <br>
          Spring (April-June) and Fall (September-October) for pleasant weather and fewer tourists.
          <br>
          Local Customs:
          <br>
          Greet with "Buongiorno" (good morning) and "Grazie" (thank you). Dress modestly when visiting churches,
          including the Vatican.
          <br>
          Transportation:
          <br>
          Metro and buses are the best options for public transport. Walking is ideal for the city center. Taxis
          and ridesharing services are also available. Be cautious of pickpockets in crowded areas.
